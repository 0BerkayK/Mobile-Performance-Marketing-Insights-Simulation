1. Executive Summary
In this analysis, we examined key performance indicators (KPIs) such as CPI, CTR, ROAS, and LTV across 20+ mobile apps in 25 countries, focusing on platform (iOS/Android) differences. Our goal was to identify patterns, anomalies, and optimization opportunities to maximize campaign effectiveness and ROI.

2. Key Findings
Country Performance:

The US and Germany show consistently high ROAS (>1.5), suggesting strong market engagement.

Turkey exhibits high CTR but comparatively lower LTV, indicating potential for retention improvement.

Platform Differences:

iOS campaigns generally have higher CPI but better LTV compared to Android.

Android shows stronger volume in impressions and installs but lower revenue per user.

Campaign Anomalies:

Significant anomalies were detected in ROAS and CPI metrics for specific countries (e.g., Brazil) during the last month, indicating unstable campaign performance.

3. Optimization Recommendations
Budget Reallocation:
Shift marketing spend towards countries with high ROAS and LTV, such as US and Germany, to maximize returns. Reduce spend in markets with low ROI until retention strategies improve.

Platform-Specific Strategies:
Invest more in iOS user acquisition while enhancing Android user engagement and monetization through targeted offers and in-app events.

Anomaly Monitoring:
Implement continuous anomaly detection to quickly identify and react to unexpected KPI changes, maintaining campaign health.

Retention Focus:
Develop retention campaigns especially in markets with high CTR but low LTV, using push notifications, rewards, and personalized content.

4. Next Steps
Deep dive into user segmentation to tailor acquisition strategies.

A/B test new creatives and offers in underperforming markets.

Integrate real-time dashboard monitoring with alerting mechanisms.
